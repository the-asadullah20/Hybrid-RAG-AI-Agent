# Hybrid-RAG-AI-Agent
Built a Hybrid RAG system to improve accuracy on complex documents. Implemented PDF ingestion, smart chunking, embeddings, and hybrid retrieval using vector search (ChromaDB) and graph logic (Neo4j). Added chat + voice input, anomaly detection, and logging with SQLite to reduce hallucinations via grounded retrieval.
